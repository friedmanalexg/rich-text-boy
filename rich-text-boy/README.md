This is a simple implementation of CKEditor copied from Darwin Tech's tutorial.

Both CKEditor and html-react-parser are pretty unstable and break easily in my experience. This was an experiment to see if I could get them working at all, because I need this functionality for another project. Now that I have them working, I am going to build out a project around them.
